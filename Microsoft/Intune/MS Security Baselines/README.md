# MS Security Baselines Exports

This folder contains exported Microsoft Security Baseline policies from Intune. The policies were created in a tenant with default settings. These files can serve as helpful references when using [IntuneDiff.com](https://intunediff.com) to review and compare custom Intune configuration policies.

 The export was performed using Microsoft Edge Developer Tools (F12), following the steps outlined in the [IntuneDiff.com User Guide](https://intunediff.com/user-guide).
